## Installation

Installation instructions for popular browsers:

  <li><a href="https://github.com/SintcoLTD/sparxmaths/blob/main/docs/install-operax.md">OperaGX</a></li>
</ul>

If you do not use any of the browsers listed above, you can paste this code into your browser's console:

s.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/SintcoLTD/CDN@main/chrome-extension/sparxmaths/console/inject.js';
document.head.appendChild(s);
